OFWorkshop_LiveCodingShaders
============================

The OpenGL Shading Language is a C-like language that allows programmers to access the power of the GPU for manipulating graphics in real-time. Because shaders are compiled at runtime, we can modify them while our code is running and see the changes without recompiling the code! This is referred to as live coding, and its seriously the most awesome thing I learned in 2013.

In this two hour workshop, participants will learn how to setup an open frameworks project to live code shaders in GLSL, the basics of vertex and fragment shaders, and how to make them interactive. We will focus on having fun and learning by experimenting, and hey! You might even remember some high school math!


Lecturer: Jason Levine

Jason Levine is a musician, performer, and creative coder. On a mission to bridge different artistic disciplines, he sees computation as a universal language for translating and communicating between different mediums. Inspired by improvisation, Jason focuses on the interactive and generative qualities of coding to create real-time software systems for live performance. He recently graduated from the first ever session of the School for Poetic Computation and nothing has been the same ever since ;)

Jason has worked extensively as a beatboxer/vocalist accompanying circus shows, street theatre, and contemporary dance. This work has been presented notably at Siguientescena(Mexico), Danza-UNAM(Mexico), Pflasterspektakel(Austria), and at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. His work fusing performance and code has been presented at ART&&CODE:3D(USA), Piksel(Norway), Carnival for e-Creativity(India), Festival de la Imagen(Colombia), and Festival Eklectik(Montreal). Most recently, Jason has worked as a freelance computational poet, designing interactive visuals for Eryc Taylor Dance, Fragile Tension, Fake Love, prototyping Kinect interactions for Harmonixâ€™s new game Fantasia:Music Evolved, and directing a music video for upcoming electronic artist Alarke. He has  contributed to the CLOUDS project and to Zach Lieberman's Devart project "Play the world".
